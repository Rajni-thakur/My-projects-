 company  Sample Data.
 ● To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial
 metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

 ● Report Data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show Particular Data.
 ● It has cards showing KPI, Financial Ratios, Budget vs Actual Performance.
